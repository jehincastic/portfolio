  My primary expertise lies in Node.js, which I leverage to build robust and reliable backend systems.
  Additionally, Iâ€™m skilled in React.js, allowing me to craft dynamic front-end experiences when the project requires it.
  Currently, Iâ€™m deepening my understanding of containerization with Docker and Kubernetes to optimize development workflows and improve application scalability.
  Iâ€™m also exploring serverless architectures, particularly within AWS, to create cloud-native solutions and stay at the forefront of modern development practices.`,
